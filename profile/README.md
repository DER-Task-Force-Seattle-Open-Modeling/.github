# DER and Open Source Data Modeling

Welcome to [DER Task Force Seattle's](https://pnwders.notion.site/PNW-DERs-Home-33d49ff437f54e12b5de8ce37bac58e9) Open Source Modeling Page.

We popularize the art and science of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) modeling using open source data tools. Projects explore technical, economic and geospatial aspects critical to the global energy transition.

# Projects
Our projects are organicly created and have creative license to explore various topics. Typical project timeframes are 2-4 months. Projects may include:
- Building energy modeling
- Distributed energy modeling
- Grid transformation and distributed energy integration
- Techno-economic analysis

# Primary Toolset
Our projects generally use the following tools.
- Anaconda
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- DER Datasets (of all types)

## Collaboration
Our project model follows the rough steps below:
- New project ideas are surfaced to the group
- A project lead writes up project concept and presents to the larger group
- Collaborators express interest to the lead
- The project lead creates a dedicated repository, checks in and organizes contributions
- Project team finalizes project and presents to the larger group
